            <p>I am currently attending University of Cincinnati working towards a degree in Computer Engineering. Over the years, courses that I have taken such as Data Structures and Discreet Computational Structures have caused me to take a liking to the software devolopment side of the field, although I still possess knowledge in the hardware side and am always open for new experiences.</p>
            <p>At this point in my career, I have been able to get around one years worth of experience working as as a software engineering intern at a company called Altamira Technologies. During my time at the company, I have acquired the skills to work with a team of developers to produce frontend applications under a set of time constraints. As time goes on, I will continue to work on projects that will focus on my aspirations to become a full-stack developer, which will be displayed on this portfolio.</p>
